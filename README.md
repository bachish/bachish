### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bachishe Olga, i'm [Software Engineering](https://mse.itmo.ru/) master student at ITMO university.

I'm interested in the area of parsers, compilers, and good optimized code in any form!

## Projects
* [UCFS](https://github.com/FormalLanguageConstrainedPathQuerying/UCFS/tree/cf_solver) - my current project as part of an internship at a St. Petersburg research center in Python IDE team. My part of the UCF solver is to implement an API parser generator for use in programming language development and tooling.
* [ssql](https://github.com/bachisheo/ssql) - prototype tool for static validation of SQL query. Allows semantic and syntactic validation of raw queries in python code.

## Skills & languages
Currently, the main programming languages are **Java** and **Kotlin**. 

In my studies and work I periodically use following: git, gradle, adoc, tex, C, C++, Bash, Python, SQL, Scala, Haskell, Rust.
